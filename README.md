## Raspberry Pi Zero Info Panel

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Little information panel showing some information gleaned mostly from Home
Assistant. Hardware is Raspberry Pi Zero with Waveshare OLED 128Ã—64 display
(SH1106). The intent is to show time, temperatures and possibly some other
information.

At this moment this is in development, so do not try to use this! Be aware
that I am learning python with this project, so there might be some serious
issues with the code.
